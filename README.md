# packageManager-ANE for Adobe AIR apps

This ANE gives you access to Android's PackageManager API to do the following tasks:

1. Know what other apps are installed on user's device.
    * Check their permissions
    * Load their app icon
    * Check/compare their signatures
    * Read their packageInfo
        * Read name
        * Read version
        * Read last update time
        * Read first install time
2. Un/Install .apk files from GooglePlay or directly from a File Object
3. Run other apps from your AIR app

**IMPORTANT:** Implementing ANEs in your AIR projects means you may be required to add some [dependencies](https://github.com/myflashlab/common-dependencies-ANE) or copy some frameworks or editing your app's manifest file. Our ANE setup instruction is designed in a human-readable format but you may still need to familiarize yourself with this format. [Read this post for more information](https://www.myflashlabs.com/understanding-ane-setup-instruction/)

If you think manually setting up ANEs in your projects is confusing or time-consuming, you better check the [ANELAB Software](https://github.com/myflashlab/ANE-LAB/).
